### Dough
- 75 g butter
- 7½ dl plain wheat flour
- ½ dl granulated sugar
- 2 ml salt
- 7 g dried yeast or 25 g fresh yeast
- 2½ dl milk

### Filling
- 75 g butter
- 2½ tsbp granulated sugar
- 1½ msk cinnamon

### Glazing
- One egg

### Preparations

Put the butter in a pot and heat on the stove until it melts. As soon as the butter has melted completely, turn the stove off and pour in the milk. Check the temperature of the mix and if necessary, leave it until it cools down to around 37°C (you can easily test with your finger). If the mix is too warm, the yeast will die off and the dough will not rise.

Transfer the mix to a bowl and add the sugar, salt and the yeast. If you are using fresh yeast, divide it into smaller bits. Add 7 dl of the flour and start kneading it until all of the liquids are absorbed by the flour. If necessary, add a tiny bit more flour to make the dough less sticky.

Cover the dough with a tea towel and leave to rise for at least 30 minutes. Leave the butter for the filling out of the fridge in order for it to reach room temperature.

Heat the oven to 225-250°C. Take the dough out of the bowl and put some flour on a clean kitchen side. Roll the dough flat into a rectangle using a pin roller (a wine bottle will also do). Try to get the thickness to around half a centimeter.

Prepare the filling by simply mixing the sugar and cinnamon with the butter. Spread it evenly across the dough. Roll the dough into a cylinder starting at one of the shorter sides. Cut the roll into 20 pieces, around 2 cm in width. Put the pieces into cupcake forms on a oven plate.

Cover the oven plate with a tea towel and leave them to rise for another 30 minutes.

After rising for the last time, mix an egg and spread it on top of the buns before placing them in the oven.

Leave them in the middle of the oven for 6 to 8 minutes. After you take them out, let them cool under a tea towel for a bit.
