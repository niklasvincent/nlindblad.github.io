Having done a lot of MongoDB at work in the past few months, I decided to take the [MongoDB University courses](https://university.mongodb.com/courses). I wanted to understand MongoDB better from both a developer, database administrator and infrastructure engineer perspective, so I ended up taking all three courses available:

- M101P: MongoDB for Developers ([my certificate of completion](http://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/2fe018cde21a4019af1c0191a2cfc049))
- M102: MongoDB for DBAs ([my certificate of completion](http://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/5d44f5c400ce4189995d847f86e140e8))
- M202: MongoDB Advanced Deployment and Operations ([my certificate of completion](http://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/562cd686f1514b78a998fe806a9103e4))

My favourite course was by far M202, which is very hands on and contains a lot of exercises that covers topics such as restoring a cluster with corrupt nodes and optimising sharded clusters.
