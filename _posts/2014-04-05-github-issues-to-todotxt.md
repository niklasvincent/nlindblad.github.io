Recently I started using [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) at both work and home. I have previously used [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com) and various GTD plugins for Gmail. Todo.txt differs because of the simplicity of the file format (just a plain text file), which makes it easy to keep the list in a Git repository and write custom tools.

The last piece of the puzzle for me was handling Github issues for my hobby projects through todo.txt as well. Inspired by the [daily review tasks](https://ifttt.com/recipes/154544-create-todo-txt-daily-review-tasks) at [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) I created a recipe for adding newly assigned Github issues to a todo.txt kept in Dropbox:
