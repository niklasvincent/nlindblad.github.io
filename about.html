<h1>About me</h1>

  <p>My name is Niklas Lindblad and I love technology in all its forms.</p>

  <p>When I was 11 I got a copy of the Borland Delphi IDE and started to play with Objective Pascal. Two years later I compiled my first Linux kernel from scratch in order to get my sound card working using ALSA instead of the (at the time) default OSS.</p>

  <p>From there on I have spent thousands of hours playing with various programming languages and operating systems.</p>

  <p>Today I work as a Software Developer for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> in London.</p>

  <p>Feel free to get in touch, you can find my <a href="/contact.html">contact information here</a>.</p>
