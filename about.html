  <h1 class="lowercase">/ About</h1>

  <p>My name is Niklas Lindblad and I love technology in all its forms.</p> 

  <p>When I was 11 I got a copy of the Borland Delphi IDE and started to play with Objective Pascal. Two years later I compiled my first Linux kernel from scratch in order to get my sound card working using ALSA instead of the (at the time) default OSS.</p>

  <p>From there on I have spent thousands of hours playing with various programming languages and operating systems.</p>

  <p>I hold a Master's of Science in Engineering, Nanoscience Engineering from the Lund Institute of Technology at Lund University, Sweden. My specialization is nano electronics, a combination of state-of-the-art semiconductor physics and traditional electronics. For <a href="https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/4124543" target="_blank">my master thesis</a> I designed mixer circuits using III-V nanowire transistors with an improved noise model.</p>

  <p>Besides my studies, I freelanced as an IT consultant through my company Lindblad IT and served a wide variety of clients ranging from tech startups to government agencies.</p>

  <p>Today I work as a Software Developer for The Guardian in London.</p>
